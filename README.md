# pocketsphinx - Go wrapper for CMU PocketSphinx

At the moment this is less of a wrapper and more of a program wrapped in a Go function that does what I'm looking for.

I plan on expanding this into a more useful wrapper over time.

## What is PocketSphinx?

[CMU Project Page](http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/)

In short, Sphinx and PocketSphinx are speech recognition toolkits.

## Dependencies

* pocketsphinx - on OS X I have only had luck with [this homebrew tap](https://github.com/watsonbox/homebrew-cmu-sphinx)
